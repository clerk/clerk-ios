/// Email addresses are used to provide identification for users.

/// The verification process always starts with the ``EmailAddress/prepareVerification(strategy:)`` method,
/// which will send a one-time verification code via an email message.
///
/// The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling the ``EmailAddress/attemptVerification(strategy:)`` method,
/// passing the one-time code as a parameter.
