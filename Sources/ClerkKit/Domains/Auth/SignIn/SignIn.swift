/// The `SignIn` object holds the state of the current sign-in process and provides helper methods
/// to navigate and complete the sign-in lifecycle. This includes managing the first and second factor
/// verifications, as well as creating a new session.
///
/// ### The following steps outline the sign-in process:
/// 1. **Initiate the Sign-In Process**
///
///    Collect the user's authentication information and pass the appropriate parameters
///    to the `SignIn.create()` method to start the sign-in.
///
/// 2. **Prepare for First Factor Verification**
///
///    Users **must** complete a first factor verification. This can include:
///    - Providing a password
///    - Using an email link
///    - Entering a one-time code (OTP)
///    - Authenticating with a Web3 wallet address
///    - Providing proof of identity through an external social account (SSO/OAuth).
///
/// 3. **Complete First Factor Verification**
///
///    Attempt to verify the user's first factor authentication details.
///
/// 4. **Prepare for Second Factor Verification (Optional)**
///
///    If multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for your application, prepare the
///    second factor verification for users who have set up 2FA for their account.
///
/// 5. **Complete Second Factor Verification**
///
///    Attempt to verify the user's second factor authentication details if MFA is required.
