/// The `SignUp` object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up process.
/// Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.
///
/// ### The Sign-Up Process:
/// 1. **Initiate the Sign-Up**:
///    Begin the sign-up process by collecting the user's authentication information and passing the appropriate parameters to the `create()` method.
///
/// 2. **Prepare the Verification**:
///    The system will prepare the necessary verification steps to confirm the user's information.
///
/// 3. **Complete the Verification**:
///    Attempt to complete the verification by following the required steps based on the collected authentication data.
///
/// 4. **Sign Up Complete**:
///    If the verification is successful, the newly created session is set as the active session.
