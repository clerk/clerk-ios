/**
 The SignIn object holds all the state of the current sign in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign in process.

 There are two important steps in the sign in flow.

 Users must complete a first factor verification. This can be something like providing a password, an email magic link, a one-time code (OTP), a web3 wallet public address or providing proof of their identity through an external social account (SSO/OAuth).
 After that, users might need to go through a second verification process. This is the second factor (2FA).
 The SignIn object's properties can be split into logical groups, with each group providing information on different aspects of the sign in flow. These groups can be:

 Information about the current sign in status in general and which authentication identifiers, authentication methods and verifications are supported.
 Information about the user and the provided authentication identifier value (email address, phone number or username). Information about each verification, either the first factor (logging in) or the second factor (2FA).
