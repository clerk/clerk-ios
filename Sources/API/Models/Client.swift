 The Client object keeps track of the authenticated sessions in the current device. The device can be a browser, a native application or any other medium that is usually the requesting part in a request/response architecture.
 The Client object also holds information about any sign in or sign up attempts that might be in progress, tracking the sign in or sign up progress.
