/**
 The `PhoneNumber` object describes a phone number. Phone numbers can be used as a proof of identification for users, or simply as a means of contacting users.

 Phone numbers must be verified to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The `PhoneNumber` object holds all the necessary state around the verification process.

 The verification process always starts with the `PhoneNumber.prepareVerification()` method, which will send a one-time verification code via an SMS message. The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling the `PhoneNumber.attemptVerification()` method, passing the one-time code as a parameter.

 Finally, phone numbers are used as part of multi-factor authentication. Users receive an SMS message with a one-time code that they need to provide as an extra verification step.
