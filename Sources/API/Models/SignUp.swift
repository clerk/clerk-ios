/**
 The `SignUp` object holds the state of the current sign up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign up flow. Once a sign up is complete, a new user is created.
 
 There are two important steps that need to be done in order for a sign up to be completed:
 
 - Supply all the required fields. The required fields depend on your instance settings.
 - Verify contact information. Some of the supplied fields need extra verification. These are the email address and phone number.
 
 The above steps can be split into smaller actions (e.g. you don't have to supply all the required fields at once) and can done in any order. This provides great flexibility and supports even the most complicated sign up flows.
 
 Also, the attributes of the `SignUp` object can basically be grouped into three categories:
 
 - Those that contain information regarding the sign-up flow and what is missing in order for the sign-up to complete. For more information on these, check our detailed sign-up flow guide.
 - Those that hold the different values that we supply to the sign-up. Examples of these are `username`, `emailAddress`, `firstName`, etc.
 - Those that contain references to the created resources once the sign-up is complete, i.e. `createdSessionId` and `createdUserId`.

     - `abandoned`: The sign-up has been inactive for a long period of time, thus it's considered as abandoned and need to start over.
